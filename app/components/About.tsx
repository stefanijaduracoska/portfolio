            I&apos;m a Full-Stack Software Engineer currently working at Banzae
            in Skopje, where I build modern web applications using TypeScript,
            React, Next.js and Node.js.
          </p>

          <p>
            My work includes developing scalable backend APIs with NestJS and
            LoopBack, designing responsive user interfaces with Tailwind and
            Material UI, and integrating frontend applications with production
            backend systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy building reliable, maintainable systems and contributing to
            products that solve real business problems while delivering great
            user experiences.
